		<h1>Medical Uses</h1>
		<p>
			Augmented and Virtual reality technology have begun making an impact on the medical field 
			over the past couple years. 
		</p>


		<p>
			In 2019 in was found that VR can fill very niche role to within the medical community. 
			If a mother is in labor and she does not want to be given or is unable to be given pain 
			killers during the labor process then she can alternativly opt to wear a head mounted 
			virtual reality device to potentially subside the pain. In a study conducted by Frey 
			in which women were placed into a virtual enviornment that simulated diving with manatees
			it was found that the women 1) Spent less time tinking about pain. 2) Felt less intense pain.
			3) rated their pain as less "unpleasent." The majority of these women then went on to claim
			that they enjoyed the experience and would be interested in further development in VR technology
			specifically for child birth.

			Augmented reality can offer benefits in the operating room as well. However, unlike the uses of VR in Frey's 
			research a study by Tepper back in 2017 focused on the ways in which Augmented reality could enhance the performance of 
			the doctors working in the operating room. This journal focuses on the uses of what was, at the time, the 
			most cutting edge AR technology available, the microsoft HoloLense. They were able to find that doctors were able to 
			increase their work efficency since they were able to access information quickly through the HoloLense rather than needing to 
			physically go find the information they are looking for. Since this study was done in 2017 and AR technology has 
			sufficently advanced since 2017 we can safely assume that AR today would be just as if not more useful that 7 years ago.
