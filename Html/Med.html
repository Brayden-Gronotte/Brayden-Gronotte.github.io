		<h1>Medical Uses</h1>
		<p>
			Augmented and Virtual reality technology have begun making an impact on the medical field 
			over the past couple years. 
		</p>


		<p>
			In 2019 in was found that VR can fill very niche role to within the medical community. 
			If a mother is in labor and she does not want to be given or is unable to be given pain 
			killers during the labor process then she can alternativly opt to wear a head mounted 
			virtual reality device to potentially subside the pain. In a study conducted by Frey 
			in which women were placed into a virtual enviornment that simulated diving with manatees
			it was found that the women 1) Spent less time tinking about pain. 2) Felt less intense pain.
			3) rated their pain as less "unpleasent." The majority of these women then went on to claim
			that they enjoyed the experience and would be interested in further development in VR technology
			specifically for child birth.
