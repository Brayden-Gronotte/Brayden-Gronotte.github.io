		<h1>Commercial Uses</h1>

			A 2024 study by Daling looked into the use case of Virtual and Augmented reality in the workplace.
			Specifically, Daling researched how virtual and augmented reality could be used in training future 
			employees in laborious and dangerous jobs. In the training AR instructions would be projected to the user 
			to help them complete their assembly task. Daling found that Augmented reality training was more effective
			than traditional training methods while virtual reality was found to only be just as effective as traditional
			methods. So, while AR may have a future in the industry of training VR seems to not have enough of an impact to 
			warrant further development in the field.

			An article from the Executive Digest written by Mana Farshid lays out a bunch of different possible uses for augmented
			and virtual reality for businesses. It outlines potential  software ideas that could be created to further the business 
			of whichever company may use them. Such ideas include an AR application that lets shoppers identify products on shelves 
			by looking at them, another could be a VR tour of a home for sale, another, an AR app that provides real time directions 
			to the user by accessing their GPS data. The article goes on to describe even more VR and AR software ideas to incorporate  
			into businesses All of these ideas could make for suitable  VR/AR applications for a software developer or development company to create.
