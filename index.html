		<h1>The state of Virtual and Augmented Reality Technology:</h1>
		<h2>Is VR/AR development worthwhile for software engineers?</h2>
		<h3>By: Brayden Gronotte</h3>


		<h4>Intro:</h4>
		<p>Since about 2016 with the release of the Oculus Rift VR and AR Technology
			have been a hot industry that many developers have kept watch on. However,
			despite the many innovations that have come to VR and AR since the release of
			the quest almost all VR and AR headsets have culturally died off within a few
			years of the beginning of their lifespans. So, is the development of VR and AR
			applications even worth it if the hardware is not yet impressive enough? Below is 
			an analysis of the different uses of VR and AR in the modern day to determine if 
			software development is feasible.
